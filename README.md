# Discord Bot Templates
This is a collection of templates for Discord bots. Each folder contains an almost ready-to-go bot that you can freely modify to your preference. I started this project to help people who want to get into creating bots.

Use the projects however you like, I would prefer if you credited me if you used them :)
My Discord is andreas#8860, add me if you have questions

## Info
All projects are sorted by beginner, intermediate and advanced. I'm not really sure how to properly rate them, so there will be a lot of overlap (stuff marked as advanced but is probably intermediate, etc.)

## Contribution
If you would like to add your own project or see an error/place for improvement in any of the projects (there will probably be a lot) just start a pull request :)
